                We want you to write about a normal day during your weak.
                <br> <br>
                Write down simple facts like when you wake up, what is your morning routine, when you eat lunch etc.
                <br> <br>
                This is meant as a baseline for this experiment. Therefore, we do not want you to write an emotional text; just simple facts.
