            <h1>Relaxed</h1>
            <p>
                We want you to recall a typical situation where you feel relaxed. 
                <br> <br>
                Perhaps it is spending a nice summer day lying in the sun, or curling up in front of the fireplace with a cup of hot chocolate and a good book. 
                <br> <br>
                Our goal is for you to experience the same emotions as you did then, so choose a situation that you are able to describe well. 
                <br> <br>
                Write down an as vivid description of the situation as possible. You may include what happend, what do you see and hear and how did that make you feel. 
                <br>

        <div class="session_information">
            <p>You can write as long as you feel, but we will stop you after 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>No one is going to read what you write. So do not let that hold you back!</p>
            <p class="important_info">Please do not press "Continue" until you are finished with the task!</p>
