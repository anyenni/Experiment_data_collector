            <h1>Relaxed</h1>
            <p>
                We want you to recall the situation where you feel the most relaxed. <br>
                Perhaps it is to spend a nice summer day lying in the sun, or curling up in front of the fireplace with a cup of hot chocolate and a good book. <br>
                Our goal is for you to experience the same emotions as you did then, so choose a situation that you are able to describe well. <br>
                Write down an as vivid description of the situation as possible. You may include what happend, what do you see and hear and how did that make you feel. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Note! No one is going to read what you write so there is no need to hold back.</p>
