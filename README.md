## How to run:
Open the file `index.html` in your favorite browser. Then you are good to go!

Everything on this page is running locally in your browser. All data is saved to the session storage. Since everything is loaded in the session storage, it is important that you do not close the browser or the open tab during the experiment. This will result in all the data being deleted.

At the end you are able to download the resulting data as .txt files. When pushing the button `Save the data`, two files will be downloaded. One contains all the data saved as a JSON string. For more info about the JSON object, check out section [...] below. 

The other file is a more readable file with only the most important practical information about the experiment.
