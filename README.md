# Experiment_data_collector
This is a web-based application for registering information from a experiment for the experiment of the project performed by Petter Skau-Nilsen during the autumn of 2021.

## How to run:
Open the file index.html in your favorite browser. Then you are good to go!

Everything on this page is running locally in your browser. All data is saved to the session storage. At the end you are able to download the resulting data as a .txt file. Since everything is loaded in the session storage, it is important that you do not close the browser or the open tab during the experiment. This will result in all the data being deleted.
